# Hello-World
A new repository

Hello, my name is Jose Chapa.

I will be trying to figure the website out and I will commit to the project because once I'm starting something I wont give up until I finish what I started. I'm 17 years old and I live with my mother and 4 siblings(1 older: 3 younger). The reason for me making this account is to help out my mother with the bills and to help out my brothers and help them get what they need for school. Hopefully I can get some help from this websites and others.
